# Autonomous AI Evolution System

An advanced AI system that evolves through autonomous interaction with computer interfaces, self-learning, and environmental adaptation - without human intervention.

## Self-Evolution Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Learning
- **Screen Analysis**: Continuously analyzes screen content to understand UI patterns and interactions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Develops understanding of interface elements and their relationships
- **Behavioral Learning**: Learns from successful and failed interactions
- **File System Learning**: Autonomously reads and learns from system files
- **Memory Management**: Maintains and evolves its knowledge base through chat and goal history

### 2. Decision Making
- **Goal Generation**: Autonomously creates objectives based on screen state and past experiences
- **Strategic Planning**: Develops and refines execution strategies
- **Error Recovery**: Self-corrects and adapts strategies when encountering failures
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains awareness of system state and capabilities

### 3. Execution & Verification
- **Autonomous Interaction**: Controls mouse and keyboard without human intervention
- **Video Recording**: Records and analyzes its own actions
- **Self-Verification**: Verifies success of actions through screen analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Improves execution efficiency through learned patterns

### 4. Evolutionary Aspects
- **Knowledge Base Growth**: Continuously expands understanding of system interactions
- **Strategy Refinement**: Improves decision-making through experience
- **Pattern Recognition Evolution**: Develops better recognition of UI elements and contexts
- **Behavioral Adaptation**: Adjusts interaction patterns based on success rates

## System Architecture

```python
orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator(api_key="your_api_key")
# Autonomous agent creation and role assignment
orchestrator.create_agent("goal_generator", "screen")  # Decides what to do
orchestrator.create_agent("goal_executor", "screen")   # Executes actions
orchestrator.create_agent("verifier", "verifier")      # Verifies outcomes
```

## Safety Mechanisms

- Fail-safe boundaries
- Command validation
- Resource monitoring
- Error detection and recovery
- Screen bounds enforcement

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV, MSS, Google Generative AI
- PyAutoGUI, Tesseract OCR
- Sufficient system resources for continuous operation

## Ethical Considerations

This system is designed to:
- Operate within defined system boundaries
- Maintain data privacy
- Follow ethical computing practices
- Prevent system harm
